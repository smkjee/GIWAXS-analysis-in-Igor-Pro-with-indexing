# Eliot's-NIKA
Custom branch of NIKA based on EliotGann/Eliots-NIKA based in Igor Pro which adds custom functionality for indexing GIWAXS peaks. The code has been tested to work on images generated at Advanced Light Source BL7.3.3. and Igor Pro 9.02. Requires Igor Pro 8 and above. 

Suggested Installation Method:

1.) Clone this repository to your local machine.  (I strongly suggest to download github desktop, which makes this incredibly easy, unless you are a github expert already.  Just paste the repository address in and hit clone)

2.) Find out where the repository is stored on your local computer

3.) open your user files directory (from Igor Pro  select Help-> Igor Pro User Files)
    usually this is in the documents/wavemetrics/ folder
    (close Igor after this step)

4.) create a shortcut (windows) or alias (Mac) of the "Nika-GIWAXS-Igor" directory into the "Igor Procedures" directory

5.) create a shortcut or alias of the "Nika-GIWAXS-User" directory into the "User Procedures" directory

6.) Install XMLUtils (https://www.wavemetrics.com/project/XMLutils)

7.) Restart Igor Pro, you should see the "Macros>Load Niak 2D SAS macros" menu appear
